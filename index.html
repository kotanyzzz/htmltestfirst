<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<hr size="5" noshade color="red"/>
<p>I am a sophomore in network and system administration. Unfortunately, I don't know much while I'm learning html. <br /> I left Linux for a while, took the road to the web. The most interesting thing for me is networks, attacks such as MITM, ARP Spoofing, MAC Flood, protocols (any).<br /> I decided to go to pentest, then maybe to DevOps. I do not know how long it will take to study, I still need to learn English, I am writing this with a translator, and I will not burn out again.<br /> It's easy to make a plan, but it's very difficult to follow. If anyone ever reads this, give me some advice and wish me luck.</p>
<p>What can I do at the moment in practice:
    <ul>
        <li>Configuring the VLAN protocol, (Cisco PT)</li>
        <li>Configuring the STP (RAPID) protocol, (Cisco PT)</li>
        <li>Standard Switch configuration,(Cisco PT)</li>
        <li>A little html</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unfortunately, there is very little practice</p>
